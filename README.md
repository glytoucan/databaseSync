# GlyTouCan CLI sample scripts

## Docs:
The [documentation](http://code.glytoucan.org/system/basic/) explains in detail how to use these scripts.

# bash scripts:

curlRemove.sh - remove linkage between a partner ID and GTC ID.
curlRemoveBySeq.sh - remove linkage between a sequence and GTC ID.

# latest developments:

  * 2020/07/03: I have lost interest in groovy and so the gtc script is not being supported.  In general an [http client](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25692515/groovy-built-in-rest-http-client/42664926) would have to be implemented.
